This is a Uni project, it was requested to recreate the nation Portuguese card game called "Sueca".

The game rules were sucessfully created, and it is indeed possible to play. However it was created only for 1 player, and the CPU always plays honestly, whereas in reality there is a social component to the game.
because every player must decide to either play clean or dirty.

As a personal challenge I took it to almost never google, just reading documentation.

The code could be better written, but hey, it is a honest days work.

You just need to run the main.py file in order to play.
